# FIND-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-TWO-PICTURES

Hi, welcome to this lesson. In this lesson we tried to create ** FIND-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-TWO-PICTURES ** using HTML-5. You can follow the steps below to analyze the codes we wrote and the result obtained.
<br/> Developed with **HTML** **"FIND-THE-DIFFERENCE-BETWEEN-TWO-PICTURES"**
>I used here **frame**, **table**, **audio**, **map**, **area**, **a** tags and I created 5 html files and then coordinated the difference in the images using the **map** and **area** tags. Then I combined the tap1, tap2, tap3, tap4 and tap5 html files by linking them to the **href** attribute with the **a** tag. From the beginning of the game, using the **audio** tag, I made an invisible game sound through the **autoplay** attribute.
